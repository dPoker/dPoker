# AceGuard Roadmap  
## Bot Detection & Trust Infrastructure

AceGuard defines a staged roadmap for building a decentralized bot detection system, starting with online poker and expanding toward a global trust infrastructure.

Each phase builds on the previous one, increasing detection sophistication, platform coverage, and operational readiness.

------------------------------------------------------------

## V0 — Foundation: Controlled Detection

**Focus:** Establish a reliable foundation for bot detection in a controlled environment.

### Scope
- Poker bot detection in a controlled environment
- Basic bot pattern identification
- Ground truth dataset generation
- Risk scoring system with evidence support
- Validator metrics framework

### Outcome
A functional detection pipeline with verified labels, measurable performance, and explainable risk scoring.

------------------------------------------------------------

## V1 — Advanced Detection & API

**Focus:** Improve detection quality and enable platform integration.

### Scope
- Sophisticated bot detection (timing, adaptation)
- Diverse human player behavioral modeling
- Open API for platform integration
- Detection dashboard with player insights
- Early detection capabilities

### Outcome
More realistic detection under adaptive behavior and the ability for platforms to consume results programmatically.

------------------------------------------------------------

## V2 — Multi-Platform Expansion

**Major milestone**

**Focus:** Generalize detection beyond a single platform and enable real-time usage.

### Scope
- Real-time in-game detection
- Platform-agnostic detection framework
- Anti-overfitting unseen bot evaluation
- Score calibration for reliability
- Extended game format support

### Outcome
Robust detection that generalizes across platforms, formats, and unseen bot strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------

## V3 — Commercial Scale

**Focus:** Enable production deployment and operational workflows.

### Scope
- Platform pilot program integration
- Comprehensive API / SDK suite
- Risk evidence dashboard for operators
- Automated action workflows
- Multi-game extension

### Outcome
Detection becomes operationally actionable at scale for real platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------

## V4 — Global Trust Infrastructure

**Focus:** Establish a universal behavior validation layer.

### Scope
- Cross-platform behavioral analysis
- Social trading & marketplace integration
- Automated dataset evolution
- Developer marketplace for tools
- Universal behavior validation

### Outcome
A decentralized trust infrastructure supporting detection, validation, and integrity across digital platforms.
